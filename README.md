# BPDTS API Client

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
But most of the Swagger stuff has been removed now.

You can build the jar in maven with
 
    mvn package

and then run the server as a standalone java application:

    java -jar target/bpdts-api-client-1.0.0.jar

The server can be accessed in a web-browser at  
http://localhost:8080/

You can also obtain the list of users in and within 50 miles of London by visiting this API directly:

http://localhost:8080/london/users
